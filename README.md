### DESCRIPTION
This is an example client application using the React Router for consuming a JSON API. It's designed to work with the [Pizza Repo API](https://github.com/stevekinney/pizza).

### UP & RUNNING
- clone the repo and run `git checkout getting-started`
- to install the node modules run `npm install`.
- run `npm start` and visit http://localhost:8080/

If you see 'Hello, World' in the browser, you're good to go!

### USING THE PIZZA API
- clone the [Pizza Repo](https://github.com/stevekinney/pizza) and run `bundle install`
- run `rackup` and visit 'http://localhost:9292/api/v1/pizzerias'

If you get back some JSON, you're all set!
There's also thorough documentation on using the API [here](https://github.com/stevekinney/pizza/blob/master/docs/using_the_api.md).
